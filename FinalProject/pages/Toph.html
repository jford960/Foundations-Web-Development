                <!-- Source: https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Toph_Beifong#Early_life -->
                <p>Toph was born in 88 AG as the only child of the wealthy Beifong family from Gaoling. Born blind, she
                    was sheltered by
                    her parents, who believed her blindness made her fragile and incapable of looking after herself.
                    They went to
                    extreme measures to protect her, including hiding her existence from the rest of the world, which
                    resulted in very
                    few people knowing that the Beifong family even had a daughter. Her parents expected their daughter
                    to be
                    well-mannered and proper due to their noble status in Earth Kingdom society, something with which
                    Toph secretly
                    disagreed, causing her to resent her parents' treatment.</p>

                <p>One day when she was around five years old, Toph ran away from home and hid in a cave inhabited by
                    badgermoles.
                    Badgermoles were the first earthbenders and according to Toph, she felt that she and the creatures
                    understood each
                    other as they were both blind. She learned earthbending by imitating their movements. In this way,
                    she learned
                    to "see" through the use of her earthbending, detecting people and other objects through their
                    vibrations, which she
                    sensed through the ground via her bare feet. Her blindness and patience helped her to develop a keen
                    sense of
                    hearing. Toph would continue to sporadically run away from home to find refuge in the Foggy Swamp
                    due to its close
                    proximity to her hometown.</p>

                <p>Lao Beifong later hired the earthbender teacher, Master Yu, to instruct her. Acting upon the orders
                    of Toph's
                    father, he did not teach her anything other than beginner's moves, unaware that she had already
                    achieved mastery in
                    the art. She became such a formidable bender that she secretly entered underground earthbending
                    tournaments as the
                    Blind Bandit, and was successful to the point where she became the champion of Earth Rumble more
                    than once. After
                    meeting Aang when she was 12 years old, Toph soon ran away in order to teach him earthbending, but
                    also to escape
                    her parents, who never granted her any real freedom</p>

                <p>
                    While Toph can't see with her eyes, she learned to use earthbending much like a sonar.
                    While on solid ground, she can detect things that are on or below ground.

                <h3>Metalbending</h3>
                <p>Toph learns to detect traces of earth in metal and becomes the first metalbender.</p>
                <h3>Lie detector</h3>
                <p>Toph can tell when most people are lying by monitoring their heartrate with earthbending.</p>
