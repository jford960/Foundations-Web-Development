                <!-- Source: https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Zuko#Early_life -->
                <p>Born in 83 AG, Zuko was the firstborn child of Prince Ozai and Princess Ursa. From a young age, he
                    was disdained by his father due to lacking the "spark in [his] eyes" typical for firebenders.
                    Indeed, Zuko would struggle to become a strong bender; however, he displayed a strong sense of
                    empathy and moralityfrom an very early point. Zuko's early years were the only ones when his family
                    was ever "actually happy". They made frequen vacations to Ember Island, and often watched the play
                    Love amongst the Dragons at the Ember Island Theater. At this point, he and Azula still had a
                    positive relationship. Zuko was schooled by Kunyo in firebending and by Piandao in
                    the art of fighting with dual broadswords.</p>

                <p>However, as they got older, Zuko and Azula eventually grew apart, and he became the object of his
                    sister's manipulation, ridicule, and deception. Their mother, however, loved both but favored him
                    over his sister, causing further jealousy and strife. Meanwhile, the relationship between Ursa and
                    Ozai also became increasingly strained and poor, causing the latter to lash out at Zuko more and
                    more. The young prince increasingly faced emotional abuse by both his father as well as his younger
                    sister. In contrast to these dysfunctional relationships, Zuko grew close to his uncle, and the two
                    often spent time together.</p>

                <p>When Zuko was eleven years old, his cousin, Lu Ten, died in battle. General Iroh, devastated by the
                    loss of his only child, abandoned his 600-day siege of the Earth Kingdom capital city, Ba Sing Se.
                    This caused a series of events which resulted in the death of Fire Lord Azulon, the enthronement of
                    Ozai, and the disappearance of Ursa. As they had been very close, the loss of his mother was
                    traumatic to Zuko. Though he was now the new Crown Prince, Zuko was also left largely isolated in
                    his family and at the mercy of both Ozai and Azula. Upon his return from the frontlines, however,
                    Iroh tried to support his nephew as well as he could.</p>


                <p>Two years later, thirteen-year-old Zuko took part in a war council with Ozai and some of his
                    generals. At the meeting, the prince fiercely spoke out against one general's suggestion to
                    callously sacrifice an entire Fire Army division. The outburst was seen as a grave insult, and Ozai
                    demanded the prince participate in an Agni Kai. He agreed, unaware that it was not the general whom
                    he had insulted, but his father. When Zuko realized the truth, he tearfully begged for his father's
                    forgiveness. Considering this another sign of cowardice and disrespect, Ozai burned Zuko by
                    permanently scarring the left side of his face. Zuko was also stripped of his birthright, and exiled
                    from his beloved homeland until he had captured the Avatar, who had disappeared nearly one hundred
                    years prior. It was a fool's errand by all accounts, but one to which Zuko clung desperately as his
                    only hope of regaining his honor and everything he had lost.</p>

                <p>Zuko spent the next two years fruitlessly and desperately searching for the Avatar. He had been given
                    a small ship, and was only accompanied by Iroh and a small crew. With these companions, he traveled
                    around the world and scoured even the most remote locations for his prize. Aside of Iroh, Zuko's
                    party took little joy in this journey.</p>
