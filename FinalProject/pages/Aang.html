				<p>
					Aang was born to two Air Nomads in 12 BG. After selecting the Avatar relics
					from among thousands of toys, thereby inadvertently confirming his identity
					as the Avatar, he was taken away by the monks of the Southern Air Temple,
					who kept his position a secret from him. As an Air Nomad, Aang traveled
					extensively around the world. During his childhood, Aang was housed, raised,
					and educated at the Southern Air Temple, under the guardianship of monk
					Gyatso, who served as his father figure, counselor, and tutor. After some
					time, he and several other young Air Nomad boys were taken to the Eastern
					Air Temple, where they each chose a sky bison as their lifelong companion.
					Aang approached his soon-to-be sky bison Appa and offered him an apple,
					which Appa accepted, thus marking the start of their deep and lifelong
					friendship.
				</p>

				<p>
					Aang was always able to excel at any new bending moves he learned; at the
					age of six, he was a better airbender than children twice his age, and by
					the age of ten, Aang had proven himself to be better than his own teachers.
					He earned airbending tattoos and the status of an airbending master by the
					age of twelve for exhibiting prodigious talent with his native element and
					with his invention of the air scooter, making him the youngest airbending
					master in Air Nomad history.
				</p>

				<p>
					In his childhood, Aang also visited the other air temples, as evidenced by
					his obvious familiarity with the Western Air Temple, as well as cities in
					the Earth Kingdom, such as Omashu, where he developed a lasting friendship
					with the good-natured but eccentric Bumi. He bonded closely with children in
					the Fire Nation, like Kuzon, with whom he went searching for a dragon in the
					mountains and saved a dragon egg from poachers.
				</p>

				<p>
					Due to the signs of a possible war approaching, Aang was told about his
					status as the Avatar at the age of twelve, four years earlier than the
					traditional age of sixteen. Aang felt burdened by his status as the other
					children refused to play with him anymore, and he came to spend more time
					practicing airbending with the monks. Monk Gyatso was the only one who
					showed an understanding of Aang's burden, having been good friends with
					Avatar Roku, Aang's past life, and tried to help ease Aang through the
					transition from childhood to adulthood by providing Aang with balance
					through fun during the upheaval in his life.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, Aang later discovered that he would be sent to the Eastern Air
					Temple in order to complete his airbending training far away from Monk
					Gyatso, whom the other monks thought was too soft on him. Afraid and
					confused, the young airbender ran away with his flying bison, Appa, though
					they became caught in a storm shortly after, which caused them to crash into
					the water. Aang saved himself and Appa from drowning by semi-consciously
					entering the Avatar State and freezing them both in a sphere of ice through
					a combination of airbending and waterbending. The Avatar State kept him
					alive, albeit not fully conscious, in the iceberg for about a hundred years
					while the war raged on.

				<h2>Special Abilities</h2>
				<span class="material-symbols-outlined"> expand_more </span>
			</button>
			<div class="btnContent">
				<h3>Bending the 4 elements</h3>
				<p>
					While all other benders can only bend one element, as the Avatar Aang is the
					only person that can learn to bend all 4 elements
				</p>
				<h3>Avatar State</h3>
				<img src="../images/aang_avatar_state.jpg" alt="" />
				<p>
					The avatar state is a special ability that links the current avatar to each
					avatar that came before them. Activating it grants the current avatar all of
					their ancestors' knowledge and power, and makes you nearly unstoppable. The
					avatar state can be activated automatically as a defense mechanism in times
					of great stress, however, dying while in the avatar state would sever an
					avatar's attachment with their past lives.
				</p>
				<h3>Travel to the spirit world</h3>
				<h3>Energy bending</h3>
				<p>
					Aang learns energybending from a giant lion turtle. It is the ability to
					bend the energy within a person. The ability is rarely learned or used
					because of it's capacity to kill the user. Using this ability successfully
					allows you to transfer knowledge, take away a person's ability to bend
					elements, or restore ability to bend elements.
