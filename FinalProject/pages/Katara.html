                <!-- Source: https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Katara?so=search#Early_life -->
                <p>Born into the diminished Southern Water Tribe capital of Wolf Cove to Hakoda and Kya, Katara faced
                    the reality of her tribe's dwindling strength from an early age. At the time of her birth, fifty
                    years of repeated Fire Nation raids intended to capture and imprison the tribe's waterbenders had
                    left them devoid of benders.
                    While the Southern Water Tribe's defenses would have crumbled under the might of the Fire Nation,
                    the tribe's relative inaccessibility in the frigid South Pole and the Fire Nation's perception that
                    they were a non-threat meant that they were mostly left alone.
                    Katara grew up within a loving, close family and community in her tribe.</p>

                <p>However, when Katara was eight, the Fire Nation again raided Wolf Cove when charged by Fire Lord
                    Azulon to find and dispose of the last remaining waterbender in the tribe. During the battle, the
                    leader of the raid Yon Rha confronted Katara's mother, who was taking refuge in the family's igloo.
                    Seeking shelter with her mother, Katara ran back to her home and interrupted their exchange.
                    Realizing the intentions of Yon Rha, who had demanded Kya tell him the identity of the waterbender,
                    Kya insisted Katara leave and gave herself up as the last waterbender, lying to protect her
                    daughter. Katara ran to fetch her father, but by the time they returned, Yon Rha had left and her
                    mother had been killed. The death of their mother had a profound impact on both Katara and Sokka,
                    and both began to feel deep hatred and resentment toward the Fire Nation as a result.</p>

                <p>With the absence of a mother figure in the family, Katara soon found herself filling the role left
                    behind by Kya. She began to take on many of the domestic responsibilities expected of women of the
                    Southern Water Tribe, despite her young age. When Katara was around twelve years old, her father,
                    Chief Hakoda, left to fight in the Hundred Year War with the rest of the men of the Southern Water
                    Tribe. Katara and Sokka were left in the care of their grandmother, Kanna.
                    Though Kanna loved the two and cared deeply for them, Katara was left feeling traumatized and alone.
                    Living in a tribe consisting almost completely of women, children, and the elderly, she took care of
                    not only her own family but of the whole Southern Water Tribe as well.</p>
