    <h1>Katara</h1>

    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <!-- Source: https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Katara?so=search#Early_life -->
    <p>Born into the diminished Southern Water Tribe capital of Wolf Cove to Hakoda and Kya, Katara faced the reality of her
    tribe's dwindling strength from an early age. At the time of her birth, fifty years of repeated Fire Nation raids
    intended to capture and imprison the tribe's waterbenders had left them devoid of benders. While the Southern Water
    Tribe's defenses would have crumbled under the might of the Fire Nation, the tribe's relative inaccessibility in the
    frigid South Pole and the Fire Nation's perception that they were a non-threat meant that they were mostly left alone.
    Katara grew up within a loving, close family and community in her tribe. When she was six years old, she broke a tooth
    on some seal jerky made by Ashuna.
    
    However, when Katara was eight, the Fire Nation again raided Wolf Cove when charged by Fire Lord Azulon to find and
    dispose of the last remaining waterbender in the tribe. During the battle, the leader of the raid Yon Rha confronted
    Katara's mother, who was taking refuge in the family's igloo. Seeking shelter with her mother, Katara ran back to her
    home and interrupted their exchange. Realizing the intentions of Yon Rha, who had demanded Kya tell him the identity of
    the waterbender, Kya insisted Katara leave and gave herself up as the last waterbender, lying to protect her daughter.
    Katara ran to fetch her father, but by the time they returned, Yon Rha had left and her mother had been killed. The
    death of their mother had a profound impact on both Katara and Sokka, and both began to feel deep hatred and resentment
    toward the Fire Nation as a result.
    
    With the absence of a mother figure in the family, Katara soon found herself filling the role left behind by Kya. She
    began to take on many of the domestic responsibilities expected of women of the Southern Water Tribe, despite her young
    age. When Katara was around twelve years old, her father, Chief Hakoda, left to fight in the Hundred Year War with the
    rest of the men of the Southern Water Tribe. Katara and Sokka were left in the care of their grandmother, Kanna.
    Though Kanna loved the two and cared deeply for them, Katara was left feeling traumatized and alone. Living in a tribe
    consisting almost completely of women, children, and the elderly, she took care of not only her own family but of the
    whole Southern Water Tribe as well.</p>
